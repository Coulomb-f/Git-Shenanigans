# Simple Question Game (Tkinter)

This is a basic desktop application built using Python's Tkinter library. It presents a series of questions to the user, advancing to the next question upon clicking a button.

## Features

- Displays questions one by one.
- Uses a "Next" button to proceed.
- Closes the application after the last question.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `hello_world.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python hello_world.py
   ```

## Customization

You can easily modify the list of questions by editing the `QUESTIONS` list within the `hello_world.py` file.
